This project is a basic registration form built using HTML, CSS and JS. It focuses on handling user inputs, validating form data on the client side, and providing feedback to the user.

The project was developed by following an online tutorial as part of a learning and revision process.
It was used to practice fundamental front-end concepts rather than to create a fully original or production-ready application.
